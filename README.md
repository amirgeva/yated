# Yet Another Text EDitor

This is a terminal based text editor, inspired by a wish to have 
an editor with default visual and key bindings that resemble typical
GUI based editors.

Main features:

* Simple arrow based navigation
* Ctrl-left/right for next prev word
* Text selection with shifted arrows
* Block indentation with tab
* Block C/C++ comment with //
* Menu to help find commands / options
* Simple macro recording
* Text search with case/whole word/regex support
